# Project Progress and Status

## What Works

The core functionality of the service is implemented and operational.

-   **Video Creation Endpoint**: The `POST /create-video` endpoint successfully generates an MP4 video.
-   **Image and Audio Sources**: The service can correctly process:
    -   Images provided as a list of URLs.
    -   Audio provided as a Base64-encoded string, with support for different audio types via the `audioType` parameter (e.g., 'mp3', 'wav').
-   **Dynamic Parameters**: The following parameters are functional:
    -   `imageUrls`: A list of URLs for the slideshow images.
    -   `durations`: An array specifying the display time for each image.
    -   `resolution`: Sets the output video's resolution (e.g., '1080x1920').
    -   `fps`: Sets the output video's frame rate.
    -   `audioBase64`: The audio track for the video.
    -   `audioType`: The type of the audio file (e.g., 'mp3', 'wav').
-   **Parallax Effect**: The `parallax: 'true'` parameter correctly applies a Ken Burns (pan and zoom) effect to the images.
-   **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is in place for missing inputs and FFmpeg processing errors.
-   **Cleanup**: The service correctly cleans up all temporary files after each request, whether it succeeds or fails.

## What's Left to Build

This is the initial version, and many improvements and features could be added.

-   **More FFmpeg Options**: Expose more FFmpeg features like:
    -   Transitions between images.
    -   Watermarking.
    -   Text overlays.
    -   Different output formats (e.g., GIF, WebM).
-   **Enhanced Error Handling**: Provide more specific error messages to the user.
-   **Direct File Uploads**: Support `multipart/form-data` for uploading image and audio files directly instead of relying on URLs and Base64.
-   **Input Validation**: More robust validation of user-provided parameters (e.g., checking if `resolution` is a valid format).
-   **Security**: Implement security measures like request throttling, authentication, and sanitizing inputs to prevent command injection (though `fluent-ffmpeg` helps mitigate this).
-   **Scalability**: The current implementation processes requests sequentially on a single instance. A more scalable solution might involve a job queue and multiple worker processes.

## Known Issues

-   No known bugs in the existing functionality.
-   The `multer` dependency is included in `package.json` but is not currently used in the code.
-   The `title` parameter is accepted in the `/create-video` endpoint but is not used in the video creation process.
