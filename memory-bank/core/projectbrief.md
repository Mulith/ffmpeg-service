# Project Brief: FFmpeg as a Service

## Core Mission

To provide a simple, accessible, and robust API that exposes the power of the FFmpeg library for video and audio manipulation. This service is designed for developers who need to perform media processing tasks without directly installing and managing FFmpeg on their own servers.

## Key Goals

1.  **Accessibility**: Offer a straightforward RESTful API that abstracts the complexity of FFmpeg commands.
2.  **Granular Control**: Allow users to specify detailed parameters for their media processing jobs, such as resolution, frame rate, and effects.
3.  **Reliability**: Ensure the service is stable, handles errors gracefully, and provides clear feedback to the user.
4.  **Statelessness**: Operate as a stateless service where each API request contains all the necessary information to perform the job.

## Target Audience

-   Developers building applications that require video/audio processing features (e.g., social media platforms, content creation tools, marketing automation).
-   Users on hosting platforms where they cannot install custom binaries like FFmpeg.
-   Teams that want to offload media processing to a dedicated microservice.
